\section{GRADUATE COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES}

So far, I have served in {{ totalCount }} committees ({{ chairCount }} as Chair, {{ coChairCount }} as Co-Chair, {{ externalMemberCount }} External Member, {{ memberCount }} as Member and {{ minorCount }} as Minor).

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llllll}
    Role & Student Name & Degree & Major & Degree Date\\
	\hline
	{% for committee in sub %}
		{{ committee.role }} & {{ committee.studentName }} & {{ committee.degree }} & {{ committee.major }} & {{ (committee.getMonth() + "/" + committee.degreeDate.getDate() + "/" + committee.degreeDate.getFullYear()) }}\\
	{% endfor %}
  \end{tabular}
