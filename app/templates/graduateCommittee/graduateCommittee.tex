\section{GRADUATE COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES}

So far, I have served in {{ count[0] }} committees ({{ count[1] }} as Chair, {{ count[2] }} as Co-Chair, {{ count[3] }} External Member, {{ count[4] }} as Member and {{ count[5] }} as Minor).

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llllll}
    Role & Student Name & Degree & Major & Degree Date\\
	\hline
	{% for committee in committees %}
		{{ committee.role }} & {{ committee.studentName }} & {{ committee.degree }} & {{ committee.major }} & {{ (committee.degreeDate.getMonth() + "/" + committee.degreeDate.getDate() + "/" + committee.degreeDate.getFullYear()) }}\\
	{% endfor %}
  \end{tabular}
