\section{GRADUATE COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES}

So far, I have served in {{ count.total }} committees ({{ count.chair }} as Chair, {{ count.coChair }} as Co-Chair, {{ count.externalMember }} External Member, {{ count.member }} as Member and {{ count.minor }} as Minor).

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llllll}
    Role & Student Name & Degree & Major & Degree Date\\
	\hline
	{% for committee in array %}
		{{ committee.role }} & {{ committee.studentName }} & {{ committee.degree }} & {{ committee.major }} & {{ (committee.getMonth() + "/" + committee.degreeDate.getDate() + "/" + committee.degreeDate.getFullYear()) }}\\
	{% endfor %}
  \end{tabular}
