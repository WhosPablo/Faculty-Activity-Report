Faculty Activity Report
================================
####[Current Release v0.1](https://github.com/tanvirt/Faculty-Activity-Report/releases/tag/v0.1)

###*NOTE: You must have LaTeX installed on your server*

This application is an attempt to replace the facultiy's need to write in latex to create their annual activity report.

By using a Single Page Web Application (SPA), the user can input and store information in an interactive form and, though a standardized report format, generate the requested PDF.

The chair (admin) can then read, edit and generate any of the faculty's reports.
